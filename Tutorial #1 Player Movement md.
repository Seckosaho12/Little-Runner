### Tutorial #1 for Player Movement

Create a new Unity project:
Open Unity, create a new 3D project, and set up your scene with a character model.

Add a Rigidbody component:
Attach a Rigidbody component to your character GameObject to enable physics interactions.

Write a simple script for movement:
Create a new C# script (e.g., PlayerMovement) and attach it to your character GameObject. Open the script in your preferred code editor.

Write the movement code:

Configure input settings:

Go back to Unity, and make sure you have set up your input settings. Go to "Edit" -> 
"Project Settings" -> "Input Manager." Ensure that the "Horizontal" and "Vertical" axes
are defined (they usually are by default for keyboard input).

Adjust speed and test:

In the Inspector window for your character GameObject, you will now see a "Player 
Movement" script component. Adjust the speed parameter to your liking. Play the 
scene and test the movement using arrow keys or WASD.


This is a simple example using the Translate method to move the character based on user input.
Depending on your game's requirements, you might need more complex
movement, animations, or collision handling. But this should give you a 
straightforward start for character movement in Unity.

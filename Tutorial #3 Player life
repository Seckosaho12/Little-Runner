Class Definition:
The script defines a class called PlayerLife that inherits from MonoBehaviour, which means it's a script for a game object in Unity.

Variables:
deathSound: A reference to an AudioSource component that plays a sound when the player dies. It's marked with [SerializeField] so that it can be set in the Unity Editor.

Update Method:

The Update method is a built-in Unity method that is called every frame.
It checks if the player's vertical position (transform.position.y) is below a certain threshold (-1f) and if the player is not already dead.
If both conditions are true, it calls the Die method.

OnCollisionEnter Method:

The OnCollisionEnter method is called when the player collides with another object.
It checks if the colliding object has a tag "Enemy Body."
If true, it does the following:
Disables the player's mesh renderer (makes the player invisible).
Makes the player's Rigidbody kinematic (freezes its movement).
Disables the script PlayerMovement attached to the player.
Calls the Die method.

Die Method:

The Die method is called when the player dies (either by falling or colliding with an enemy).
It does the following:
Delays the execution of the ReloadLevel method by 1.3 seconds using Invoke.
Sets the dead variable to true.
Plays the death sound.


ReloadLevel Method:

The ReloadLevel method reloads the current scene when called, effectively restarting the game.

In conclusion this script manages the player's life in a game. If the player falls below a certain height or collides with an object tagged as "Enemy Body," 
the player is considered dead. The game then hides the player, freezes its movement, disables its movement script, plays a death sound, delays for a short period,
and then reloads the level to restart the game.

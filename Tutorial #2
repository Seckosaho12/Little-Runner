Step 1: Create a collectible item

Right-click in the Assets window, select "Create," and choose "Sprite" to create a 2D sprite for your collectible item.

Import or design an image for your collectible item and assign it to the sprite renderer component of the new created sprite.

Step 2: Set up the collectible item

Drag the sprite into the scene to create a GameObject.

Attach a Collider component to the GameObject
(Box Collider 2D for 2D games or Mesh Collider for 3D games). 
This collider will define the area where the player can collect the item.

Step 4: Create a script for the collectible item

Right-click in the Assets window, select "Create," and choose "C# Script."
Name the script something like "CollectibleItem" and double-click to open it in your preferred code editor.
In the script, you'll need to create a method for handling the collection. Here's a basic example:

Step 5: Attach the script to the collectible item

Drag and drop the script onto the GameObject with the collectible item in the Inspector window.

Step 6: Tag your player
Select your player GameObject in the scene.
In the Inspector window, find the "Tag" dropdown, and assign a tag (e.g., "Player") to your player GameObject.


Step 7: Testing
Press the play button in Unity and test your game. When the player GameObject (with the specified tag) 
collides with the collectible item, it should trigger the collection logic.

This is the completed script for my collectible item.

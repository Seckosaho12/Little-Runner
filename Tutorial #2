Step 1: Create a collectible item

Right-click in the Assets window, select "Create," and choose "Sprite" to create a 2D sprite for your collectible item.

Import or design an image for your collectible item and assign it to the sprite renderer component of the new created sprite.

Step 2: Set up the collectible item

Drag the sprite into the scene to create a GameObject.

Attach a Collider component to the GameObject
(Box Collider 2D for 2D games or Mesh Collider for 3D games). 
This collider will define the area where the player can collect the item.

Step 4: Create a script for the collectible item

Right-click in the Assets window, select "Create," and choose "C# Script."
Name the script something like "CollectibleItem" and double-click to open it in your preferred code editor.
In the script, you'll need to create a method for handling the collection. Here's a basic example:

Step 5: Attach the script to the collectible item

Drag and drop the script onto the GameObject with the collectible item in the Inspector window.

Step 6: Tag your player
Select your player GameObject in the scene.
In the Inspector window, find the "Tag" dropdown, and assign a tag (e.g., "Player") to your player GameObject.


Step 7: Testing
Press the play button in Unity and test your game. When the player GameObject (with the specified tag) 
collides with the collectible item, it should trigger the collection logic.

This is the completed script for my collectible item.

Class Definition:

The script defines a new class named ItemCollector that inherits from MonoBehaviour. In Unity, scripts that control game behavior are typically derived from MonoBehaviour.

Variables:

coins: An integer variable to keep track of the number of collected coins.
coinsText: A reference to a UI Text component that will display the number of collected coins. It's marked with [SerializeField] so that it can be set in the Unity Editor.
collectionSound: A reference to an AudioSource component that will play a sound when a coin is collected. Also marked with [SerializeField] for editor visibility.

OnTriggerEnter Method:

Unity calls this method automatically when the GameObject this script is attached to collides with another GameObject.
It checks if the colliding GameObject has a tag "Coin" using CompareTag.
If a collision with a coin occurs:
Destroys the coin GameObject.
Increments the coins count.
Updates the UI Text to display the new number of collected coins.
Plays a sound using the AudioSource component.

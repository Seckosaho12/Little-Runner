Step 1: Create a collectible item

Right-click in the Assets window, select "Create," and choose "Sprite" to create a 2D sprite for your collectible item.

Import or design an image for your collectible item and assign it to the sprite renderer component of the new created sprite.

Step 2: Set up the collectible item

Drag the sprite into the scene to create a GameObject.

Attach a Collider component to the GameObject
(Box Collider 2D for 2D games or Mesh Collider for 3D games). 
This collider will define the area where the player can collect the item.

Step 4: Create a script for the collectible item

Right-click in the Assets window, select "Create," and choose "C# Script."
Name the script something like "CollectibleItem" and double-click to open it in your preferred code editor.
In the script, you'll need to create a method for handling the collection.
